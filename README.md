### 10. If your program is segfaulting and you can’t figure out why, what steps would you take?

> While most errors can be detected using manual debugging (eg: inserting printf statements), some errors are hard to detect just by observing the values of variables. The compiler may rearrange the order of the execution making the programmer think that an error occurred in a different place than the actual location. The best way to debug C code is to use some of the tools available from GNU. The most widely used tool for debugging C programs is the GDB.
